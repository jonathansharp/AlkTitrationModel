# TITRATE.m

Program to simulate a natural water titration in the presence of an unidentified dissolved organic acid and provide measured total alkalinity values using five distinct data analysis methods. The methods used are modified Gran function analysis, a nonlinear least squares fit in a closed cell, a nonlinear least squares fit in an open cell, difference derivative analysis, and a spectrophotometric single-step titration.
